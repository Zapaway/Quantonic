- (for qubit representation) use a special type of object pooling where the capacity
    is the controllable with the most amount of qubits
- (for quick qubit viewer) you can add a button component onto render images to get clickable actions and menu navigations
    - to customize keys, create a new action map and reference it in "EventSystem" GameObject
- create these action maps
    - Controllable: any moves that a controllable can take
    - StageUI: for interacting with the UI in the stage
    - PauseUI: for interacting with the UI with the pause menu
    - *toggle ESC*: switch between (Controllable w/ StageUI) | (PauseUI) action maps

TODO:


FUTURE GOAL:
    - with key input, only allow moving between qubit representations
        - the leftmost qubit representation acts like a left arrow button when pressing left on it
        it should still have the leftmost qubit representation selected after pressing
        - same with right
    - with mouse input, the arrow buttons can be clicked on to move between 
        - clicking on a qubit representation should submit unless if in multi-select mode
