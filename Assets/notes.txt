- (for qubit representation) use a special type of object pooling where the capacity
    is the controllable with the most amount of qubits
- (for quick qubit viewer) you can add a button component onto render images to get clickable actions and menu navigations
    - to customize keys, create a new action map and reference it in "EventSystem" GameObject
- create these action maps
    - Controllable: any moves that a controllable can take
    - StageUI: for interacting with the UI in the stage
    - PauseUI: for interacting with the UI with the pause menu
    - *toggle ESC*: switch between (Controllable w/ StageUI) | (PauseUI) action maps

TODO:
    - only set the qubit limit to 5
    -> camera
    -> splitting clones using QSM
