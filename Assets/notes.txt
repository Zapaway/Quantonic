TODO:
    - create finish line (measurement gate)
    - create necessary visual cues (e.g. type of gate)
    - add gate wall 
    - create text that states what is happening (slightly above player - e.g. "you cannot jump yet")
    * add effects

BUGS:
    - teleporting down near the edge brings you out
    
    - dont allow clone from entangled qubits
    - dont allow target entangled qubits to be passed into unary gates
    - dont allow controlled entangled qubits to entangle with other qubits except the one that it is with (for deentanglement)
